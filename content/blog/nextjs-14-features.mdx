# Exploring Next.js 14's New Features

Next.js 14 brings a host of exciting new features and improvements that make building modern web applications even more efficient and powerful.

## Server Actions

One of the most significant additions to Next.js 14 is Server Actions. These allow you to run server-side code directly from your components:

\`\`\`typescript
'use server'

async function submitForm(formData: FormData) {
  const name = formData.get('name')
  const email = formData.get('email')
  
  await db.users.create({
    data: { name, email }
  })
  
  revalidatePath('/users')
}
\`\`\`

## Partial Prerendering

Next.js 14 introduces Partial Prerendering, which combines static and dynamic rendering:

\`\`\`typescript
export default async function Page() {
  // This part is statically rendered
  const staticData = await fetch('/api/static-data')
  
  // This part is dynamically rendered
  const dynamicData = await fetch('/api/dynamic-data', {
    next: { revalidate: 60 }
  })
  
  return (
    <div>
      <StaticComponent data={staticData} />
      <DynamicComponent data={dynamicData} />
    </div>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Improved Image Component

The Image component has been enhanced with better performance and new features:

\`\`\`typescript
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/images/photo.jpg"
      alt="Description"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      priority
      quality={90}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
    />
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Turbopack Improvements
