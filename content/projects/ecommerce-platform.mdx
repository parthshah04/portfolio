# E-commerce Platform

A modern e-commerce platform built with Next.js 14, featuring a seamless shopping experience and robust backend integration.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the power of Next.js 14 in building a full-featured e-commerce platform. The application includes:

- Server-side rendering for optimal SEO
- Real-time inventory management
- Secure payment processing with Stripe
- Responsive design for all devices
- Advanced search and filtering
- User authentication and profiles

## Technical Implementation

The platform is built using a modern tech stack:

\`\`\`typescript
// Example of product fetching
async function getProducts() {
  const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
    include: {
      category: true,
      images: true,
    },
  });
  return products;
}
\`\`\`

## Key Features

1. **Performance Optimized**
   - Server Components for faster page loads
   - Image optimization with next/image
   - Efficient data fetching patterns

2. **Secure Payments**
   - Stripe integration for secure transactions
   - Webhook handling for payment events
   - Order management system

3. **User Experience**
   - Smooth animations with Framer Motion
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Accessible components with shadcn/ui

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the main challenges was implementing real-time inventory updates. We solved this by:

1. Using WebSocket connections for live updates
2. Implementing optimistic UI updates
3. Adding fallback mechanisms for offline support

## Results

The platform has achieved:

- 95+ Lighthouse performance score
- 99.9% uptime
